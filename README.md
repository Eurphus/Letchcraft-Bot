# Letchcraft-Bot

Very simple discord bot that currently has the follow features:
- Channel Counting System
- Welcoming & Autorole
- Ghost ping detection
- Levelling System
- Modmail
- Automated moderation with punishment determined off of previous punishment
- and more!

The bot requires a active MySQL connection in order to use it.

This bot was developed for an older version of discord.js, some functions may not work on the latest version.

Some variables are hardcoded, and must be replaced in the code rather then a configuration file.

Development has been abandoned for ~1.5 years now.
